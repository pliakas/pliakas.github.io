    I am passionate software engineer, where he likes to work in performance improvements in each phase of the project life cycle. I have primarily been working on architecting, developing, and tuning low latency and high throughput products, mainly in mobile telco industry..
      This blog explores a variety of topics that I've faced across in my journey as a software engineer. Even though mostly written for my own understanding, my hope is that the curious programmer finds my writings interesting.
